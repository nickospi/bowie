<p class="lead"> Down where your paint is cracking
Look down you backstair buddy
Somebody&#39;s living there and
He don&#39;t really feel the weather
And he don&#39;t share your pleasures
No he don&#39;t share your pleasures
Look at his eyes
Did you see his crazy eyes

You&#39;re so surprised he don&#39;t run to catch your ash
Everybody always wants to kiss your trash

Ah you can&#39;t help him
Nobody can
Now that he knows
There&#39;s nothing to get
Will you still place your bet
On the neighborhood threat

Somewhere a baby&#39;s bleeding
Somewhere a mother&#39;s needing
Outside a boy is lying
But mostly he is crying
And he just shouts in anger
You&#39;ll find him interesting
Look at his eyes
Did you see his crazy eyes
You&#39;re so surprised he doesn&#39;t build for you
Everybody always wants to run with you

Ah you can&#39;t help him
Nobody can
Now that he knows
There&#39;s nothing to get
Will you still place your bet
On the neighborhood threat

You&#39;re so surprised he don&#39;t run to catch your ash
Everybody always wants to kiss your trash

Ah you can&#39;t help him
Nobody can
Now that he knows
There&#39;s nothing to get
Will you still place your bet
On the neighborhood threat
On the neighborhood threat (a night in your face)
Don&#39;t place your bets (a night in your place)
On the neighborhood threat (will you still place your bets)
Don&#39;t place your bets (when the neighbor comes)
On the neighborhood threat (neighborhood threat)
Don&#39;t place yor bets
On the neighborhood threat</p>
