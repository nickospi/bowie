- Lyrics and music by David Bowie 

Still the leaves are spinning &#39;round
Take my hand as we go down, and down, and down
Looking for water 
Well, our light&#39;s gone in a New York minute
Don&#39;t know about you, but my heart&#39;s not in it
(Looking, looking, looking)
I&#39;m looking for water
I&#39;m looking for water
(Looking, looking, looking)

I can&#39;t breathe the air, can&#39;t raise a fact
&#39;Cause all we&#39;ve got left is a beat in the night, and I&#39;m
(Looking for water)
Looking for water
(Looking for water)
(Looking, looking)

Take my hand as we go down, and down
Leave it all behind, nothing could be found
(I&#39;m, looking for water)
I&#39;m looking for water
(Looking for water)
(Looking, looking)
(I, looking for water)
Looking everywhere
(Looking for water)
Looking here and there
(I&#39;m looking for water)
I&#39;m looking for water
(Looking for water)
(Looking, looking)
I can&#39;t live in this cage, I can&#39;t eat this candy
The edge of the earth to the spin in my head
The look in your eyes and never means never
The dawn&#39;s early light, baby, dark is forever

(Looking, looking)
(Looking, looking)

(Looking for water)
(Looking, looking)
I
(Looking for water)
(Looking for water)
(Looking, looking)
I
(Looking for water)
(Looking for water)
(Looking, looking)
I
(Looking for water)
(Looking for watter)
Looking, looking)
I
(Looking for water)
(Looking for watter)
Looking, looking)
I
(Looking for water)
(Looking for watter)</p>
