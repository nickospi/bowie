<p class="lead"> War made him a soldier 
Little Frankie Mear 
Peace left him a loser 
The little bombardier 

Lines of worry appeared with age 
Unskilled hands that knew no trade 
Spent his time in the picture house 
The little bombardier 

Frankie drank his money 
The little that he made 
Told his woes to no man 
Friendless, lonely days 

Then one day, in the ABC 
Four bright eyes gazed longingly 
At the ice-cream in the hand of 
The little bombardier 

Sunshine entered our Frankie&#39;s days 
Gone his worries, his hopeless maze 
His life was fun and his heart was full of joy 

Two young children had changed his aims 
He gave them toffees and played their games 
He brought them presents with every coin he made 

Then two gentlemen called on him 
Asked him for his name 
Why was he friends with the children 
Were they just a game? 

Leave them alone or we&#39;ll get sore 
We&#39;ve had blokes like you in the station before 
The hand of authority said &#34;no more&#34; to 
The little bombardier 

Packed his bags, his heart in pain 
Wiped a tear and caught a train 
Not to be seen in the town again 
The little bombardier</p>
