<p class="lead"> Let the lies go
Let...

He&#39;s everybody&#39;s token, on everybody&#39;s wall
Blessing all the papers, thanking one and all
Hugging all the babies, kissing all the ladies
Knowing all that you think about from writing on the wall

He&#39;s so divine, his soul shines
Breaks the night, sleep tight
His ever loving face smiles on the whole human race
He says &#34;I&#39;m somebody&#34;
He&#39;s got his eye on your soul, his hand on your heart
He says &#34;Don&#39;t hurry, baby
Somebody up there (somebody) likes me&#34;

He&#39;s the savage son of the TV tube
Planets wrote the day was due
All the wisest men around
Predicted that a man was found
Who looked a lot like you and me, yeah
Everyone with sense could see
Nothing left his eye unmoved, he
Had the plan, he had to use

(Somebody) He&#39;s so divine (Oh oh) his soul shines
(Somebody) Breaks the night, sleep tight
(Somebody up there, somebody)
His ever loving face (Oh oh) smiles on the whole human race (Somebody somebody somebody up there)
(Somebody)
He&#39;s got his eye on your soul, (Oh oh) his hand on your heart
He says &#34;Don&#39;t hurry, baby
Somebody up there (somebody)

Somebody plays my song in tune
Makes me, makes me, makes me stronger for you, babe
Was a way when we were young, that
Any man was judged by what he&#39;d done
But now you pick them on the screen (what they look like)
Where they&#39;ve been

He&#39;s got his eye on your soul, his hand on your heart
He says (&#34;Don&#39;t hurry, baby) don&#39;t hurry baby
Somebody up there (somebody) please go (Oh oh)

Leaders come, and all the people knew
That given time the leaders go (Somebody somebody)
Tell me, can they hold you under the spell (Oh oh)
Can the ball game hold as well?
Does he smile like Valentino?
Could he sell you anything?
(Somebody somebody)
Keep your eyes on your soul,(Oh oh) keep your hand on your heart
(Don&#39;t hurry me baby)
Don&#39;t hurry, baby
Somebody up there (somebody) likes me&#34;
(Somebody, somebody, somebody)
(Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody)
Somebody (somebody) somebody (somebody) somebody (somebody, somebody)
Somebody (somebody) somebody (somebody) somebody (somebody, somebody)
Can&#39;t remember (somebody) peace so well
Oh, space to ramble, (somebody, somebody) space to boogie

Soul shine (Ooh-ooh)
So divine
Somebody (ooh-ooh, somebody)

Soul shine (Ooh-ooh)
So divine
Somebody (ooh-ooh)

Somebody, somebody, somebody
Yeah, Get me man, place your man
Get me man, space your man
Get me man, space your man
Soul shine
Soul shine
So divine
So divine
Soul shine
So divine
So divine</p>
