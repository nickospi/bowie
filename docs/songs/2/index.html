<p class="lead"> (Baby loves that way)
Yes, she does, yes, she does
(Baby loves that way)
Oh, I love my baby
(Baby loves that way)
Ooh, I gotta take her
(Baby loves that way)
Yep, I love her

Baby likes to go outside, so I let her
Wants to fool with other guys, so I let her
Wants to be bad, so I let her be bad
But fooling around, it will make me sad
She fools around with other boys and treat me like an unwanted toy

(Baby loves that way)
Oh, I love my baby
(Baby loves that way)
Ooh, she does too much to me
(Baby loves that way)
And I can&#39;t think too much of her
(Baby loves that way)
Gotta take her, gotta take her

Gonna better leave her alone, put you down son
Treating her real fine, thus I&#39;m home being a loner
Jeanny&#39;s my babe and that&#39;s alright, yeah
She treats me good, each and every night
She fools around with other boys and treat me like an unwanted toy

(Baby loves that way)
I love my baby
(Baby loves that way)
Ooh, she&#39;s too much
(Baby loves that way)
Yes she does, yes she does
(Baby loves that way)

(Baby loves that way)
I love my baby
(Baby loves that way)
Yeah, she&#39;s too much, yeah yeah
(Baby loves that way)
Ooh, I think she can live with me
(Baby loves that way)
Love her, love her, love her

Baby likes to go outside, so I let her
Wants to fool with other guys, so I let her
Wants to be bad, so I let her be bad
But fooling around, it will make me sad
She clings around with all the boys, who treat her like unwanted toys

(Baby loves that way)
Obviously this is the end
(Baby loves that way)
Gotta take her
(Baby loves that way)
Ooh yeah
(Baby loves that way)
Can&#39;t do enough
(Baby loves that way</p>
