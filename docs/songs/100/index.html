<p class="lead"> The return of the Thin White Duke
Throwing darts in lovers&#39; eyes
Here are we, one magical moment, such is the stuff
From where dreams are woven
Bending sound, dredging the ocean, lost in my circle
Here am I, flashing no colour
Tall in this room overlooking the ocean

Here are we, one magical movement from Kether to Malkhuth
There are you, you drive like a demon from station to station
The return of the Thin White Duke, throwing darts in lovers&#39; eyes
The return of the Thin White Duke, throwing darts in lovers&#39; eyes
The return of the Thin White Duke, making sure white stains

Once there were mountains on mountains
And once there were sunbirds to soar with
And once I could never be down
Got to keep searching and searching
Oh, what will I be believing and who will connect me with love?
Wonderful, wonder who, wonder when
Have you sought fortune, evasive and shy?
Drink to the men who protect you and I
Drink, drink, drain your glass, raise your glass high

It&#39;s not the side-effects of the cocaine
I&#39;m thinking that it must be love
It&#39;s too late to be grateful
It&#39;s too late to be late again
It&#39;s too late to be hateful
The European canon is here

I must be only one in a million
I won&#39;t let the day pass without her
It&#39;s too late to be grateful
It&#39;s too late to be late again
It&#39;s too late to be hateful
The European canon is here, yes it&#39;s here

Should I believe that I&#39;ve been stricken?
Does my face show some kind of glow?
It&#39;s too late to be grateful
It&#39;s too late to be late again
It&#39;s too late to be hateful
The European canon is here, yes it&#39;s here

It&#39;s too late
It&#39;s too late
It&#39;s too late
It&#39;s too late
It&#39;s too late
The European canon is here

Well, it&#39;s not the side-effects of the cocaine
I&#39;m thinking that it must be love
It&#39;s too late to be grateful
It&#39;s too late to be late again
It&#39;s too late to be hateful
The European canon is here

I must be only one in a million
I won&#39;t let the day pass without her
It&#39;s too late to be grateful
It&#39;s too late to be late again
It&#39;s too late to be hateful
The European canon is here, yes it&#39;s here

Should I believe that I&#39;ve been stricken?
Does my face show some kind of glow?
It&#39;s too late to be grateful
It&#39;s too late to be late again
It&#39;s too late to be hateful
The European canon is here, yes it&#39;s here

It&#39;s too late
It&#39;s too late
It&#39;s too late
It&#39;s too late
It&#39;s too late
The European canon is here</p>
