<p class="lead"> Oh, hear this, Robert Zimmerman
I wrote a song for you
About a strange young man called Dylan
With a voice like sand and glue
His words of truthful vengeance
They could pin us to the floor
Brought a few more people on
And put the fear in a whole lot more

Ah, here she comes
Here she comes
Here she comes again
The same old painted lady
From the brow of a superbrain
She&#39;ll scratch this world to pieces
As she comes on like a friend
But a couple of songs
From your old scrapbook
Could send her home again

You gave your heart to every bedsit room
At least a picture on the wall
And you sat behind a million pair of eyes
And told them how they saw
Then we lost your train of thought
The paintings are all your own
While troubles are rising
We&#39;d rather be scared
Together than alone

Ah, here she comes
Here she comes
Here she comes again
The same old painted lady
From the brow of a superbrain
She&#39;ll scratch this world to pieces
As she comes on like a friend
But a couple of songs
From your old scrapbook
Could send her home again

Now hear this, Robert Zimmerman
Though I don&#39;t suppose we&#39;ll meet
Ask your good friend Dylan
If he&#39;d gaze a while down the old street
Tell him we&#39;ve lost his poems
So we&#39;re writing on the walls
Give us back our unity
Give us back our family
You&#39;re every nation&#39;s refugee
Don&#39;t leave us with their sanity

Ah, here she comes
Here she comes
Here she comes again
The same old painted lady
From the brow of a superbrain
She&#39;ll scratch this world to pieces
As she comes on like a friend
But a couple of songs
From your old scrapbook
Could send her home again

Ah, a couple of songs
From your old scrapbook
Could send her home again

Oh, here she comes
Here she comes
Here she comes</p>
