<p class="lead"> I&#39;m up on the eleventh floor 
And I&#39;m watching the cruisers below 
He&#39;s down on the street 
And he&#39;s trying hard to pull sister Flo
Oh, my heart&#39;s in the basement 
My weekend&#39;s at an all time low 
&#39;Cause she&#39;s hoping to score 
So I can&#39;t see her letting him go 

Walk out of her heart 
Walk out of her mind 
Oh, not her

She&#39;s so swishy in her satin and tat 
In her frock coat and bipperty-bopperty hat 
Oh God, I could do better than that
Oh yeah

She&#39;s an old-time ambassador of sweet talking, night walking games
Oh and she&#39;s known in the darkest clubs for pushing ahead of the dames
If she says she can do it, then she can do it
She don&#39;t make false claims 
But she&#39;s a queen, and such are queens, that your laughter is sucked in their brains 

Now she&#39;s leading him on 
And she&#39;ll lay him right down 
Yes, she&#39;s leading him on 
And she&#39;ll lay him right down 
But it could have been me 
Yes, it could have been me 
Why didn&#39;t I say? Why didn&#39;t I say?
No, no, no 

She&#39;s so swishy in her satin and tat 
In her frock coat and bipperty-bopperty hat 
Oh God, I could do better than that 

So I lay down a while and I gaze at my hotel wall
Oh the cot is so cold, it don&#39;t feel like no bed at all
Yeah, I lay down a while and I look at my hotel wall
But he&#39;s down on the street so I throw both his bags down the hall
And I&#39;m phoning a cab &#39;cause my stomach feels small
There&#39;s a taste in my mouth and it&#39;s no taste at all
It could have been me, oh yeah, it could have been me
Why didn&#39;t I say, why didn&#39;t I say
No, no, no 

She&#39;s so swishy in her satin and tat 
In her frock coat and bipperty-bopperty hat 
Oh God, I could do better than that</p>
