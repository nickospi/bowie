<p class="lead"> Let me put my arms around your head
Gee, it&#39;s hot, let&#39;s go to bed
Don&#39;t forget to turn on the light
Don&#39;t laugh, babe, it&#39;ll be all right
Pour me out another phone
I&#39;ll ring and see if your friends are home
Perhaps the strange ones in the dome
Can lend us a book we can read up alone
And try to get it on like once before
When people stared in Jagger&#39;s eyes and scored
Like the video films we saw

His name was always Buddy
And he&#39;d shrug and ask to stay
She&#39;d sigh like Twig the Wonder Kid
And turn her face away
She&#39;s uncertain if she likes him
But she knows she really loves him
It&#39;s a crash course for the ravers
It&#39;s a drive-in Saturday

Jung the foreman prayed at work
That neither hands nor limbs would burst
It&#39;s hard enough to keep formation
Amid this fallout saturation
Cursing at the Astronette
That stands in steel by his cabinet
He&#39;s crashing out with Sylvian
The Bureau Supply for aging men
With snorting head he gazes to the shore
Where once had raged a sea that raged no more
Like the video films we saw

His name was always Buddy
And he&#39;d shrug and ask to stay
And she&#39;d sigh like Twig the Wonder Kid
And turn her face away
She&#39;s uncertain if she likes him
But she knows she really loves him
It&#39;s a crash course for the ravers
It&#39;s a drive-in Saturday

His name was always Buddy
And he&#39;d shrug and ask to stay
And she&#39;d sigh like Twig the Wonder Kid
And turn her face away
She&#39;s uncertain if she likes him
But she knows she really loves him
It&#39;s a crash course for the ravers
It&#39;s a drive-in Saturday, yeah
Yeah

Drive-in Saturday
It&#39;s a drive-in Saturday
Drive, drive-in Saturday (It&#39;s a drive-in Saturday)
It&#39;s a, it&#39;s a, it&#39;s a, it&#39;s a drive-in Saturday, yeah (It&#39;s a drive-in Saturday)
It&#39;s a, it&#39;s a, it&#39;s a, yes, sir, yes, sir, yes, sir, yes, sir (It&#39;s a drive-in Saturday)
Yes, sir, yes, sir (It&#39;s a drive-in Saturday)
(It&#39;s a drive-in Saturday)
Yes, sir, yes, sir (It&#39;s a drive-in Saturday)</p>
